# English-Braille-Translator
An US-English to Braille Translator 
English-Braille-Translator is a python code which translates US English to Braille.
In the code a created a python function for a US English letters, numbers, and characters then translated it with the corresponding letters, numbers, and characters for Braille. 
Expect this code to be extremly bare bones, as it's my first code written in python and I wrote it to help me understand python better.
